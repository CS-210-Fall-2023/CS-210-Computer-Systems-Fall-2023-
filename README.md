# CS 210 Computer Systems (Fall 2023)
## Welcome!
### [Syllabus]()
### Course description
Our goal is to:
1) to provide a foundation for understanding how computer systems work from a software perspective,
2) demystify the complex layers of software that make up the world around us and
3) learn a new set of technical competencies.
   
The course roughly breaks down into 3 major parts as follows:
- The UNIX Development Environment: Learning what an OS Kernel is, what User Process are and the tools of the trade that go into developing foundational software.
- The von Neumann computer architecture: Learning the binary model of a computer and binary representation of software, through assembly programming.
- Into the Light: Learning how we bridge the binary model and representation to a human friendly programming, through the ``C'' programming language tool-chain.

CS 210 is a principal course for computer science majors. It provides the fundamental knowledge to understand what software and hardware are. It is also the background for courses in the systems area such as operating systems, compilers, networks, not to mention more advanced courses in computer architecture.
### Prerequisites
This course assumes that students have a solid background in programming concepts from CAS CS 111. CS 112 is also recommended, but not essential for students with strong programming skills. CS 131 or MA 293 is important for the material on Boolean logic and data representation.
